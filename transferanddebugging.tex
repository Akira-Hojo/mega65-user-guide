\chapter{Data Transfer and Debugging Tools}

The key to effective cross-platform development is having quick and
easy means to deploy and test software on the MEGA65.  This is
especially true while the MEGA65 emulator continues to be developed.
In fact, even once the MEGA65 emulator is complete, it is unlikely
that it will be able to offer full compatibility at full speed,
because the MEGA65 is much more demanding to emulate than the C64.

There are a variety of tools that can be used for data transfer and
debugging.  These typically function using either the MEGA65's serial
monitor interface, or via the MEGA65's fast ethernet adapter.  The
serial monitor interface is available via the UART lines on the JB1
header.

If you do not have access to the serial monitor interface, there are
tools being developed for the fast ethernet port that provide some,
but not all, of the capabilities of the serial monitor
interface. These will be documented as they become available. The
remainder of this chapter focusses on methods that access the serial
monitor interface.

You can either connect a 3.3V UART adaptor to the appropriate
lines, or more conveniently, connect a TE-0790-03 JTAG debug module
onto this connector.  This gives you a USB connection that can be used
for injecting software, remote debugging and memory inspection, as
well as activating or flashing bitstreams.  With this connection,
there are the following tools:

\section{m65 command line tool}

The \url{https://github.com/mega65/mega65-tools} repository contains a
number of tools, utilities and example programmes.  One of those is
the \stw{m65} command line tool. This is rather a swiss-army
knife collection of utilities in one.  Common useful functions
include:

\subsection{Screenshots using m65 tool}

To take a screenshot of the MEGA65 use:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -S
\end{screenoutput}

This will create a file called \stw{mega65-screeen-000000.png},
or if that file already exists, the first non-used number will be used
in place of \stw{000000}.

Note that this screenshot function works by having \stw{m65} emulate the
function of the VIC-IV. Thus while it produces excellent looking
digital screenshots, it may not exactly match the real display of the
MEGA65.  At the time of writing it does not render sprites or
bitplanes, only text and bitmap-based video modes.

\subsection{Load and run a programme on the MEGA65}

To load and run a programme on the MEGA65, you can use a command like:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -F -4 -r foo.prg
\end{screenoutput}

The \stw{-F} option tells \stw{m65} to reset the MEGA65
before loading the programme.

The \stw{-4} option tells \stw{m65} to switch the MEGA65
to C64 mode before loading the programme. If this is left off, then it
will attempt to load the programme in C65 mode.

The \stw{-r} option tells \stw{m65} to run the programme
immediately after loading.

Note that this command works using the normal BASIC LOAD command, and
is thus limited to loading programmes into the lower 64KB of RAM

\subsection{Reconfigure the FPGA to run a different bitstream}

To try out a different bitstream, a command like the following can be
used:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -b bitstream.bit
\end{screenoutput}

This will cause the named bitstream to be sent to the FPGA.  As the
FPGA will be reconfigured by this action, and programme currently
running will not merely be stopped, but also main memory will be
cleared. For models of the MEGA65 that are fitted with 8MB or 16MB of
expansion memory, those expansion memories are implemented in external
chips, and so the contents of them will not be erased.

\subsection{Remote keyboard entry}

The MEGA65's keyboard interface logic supports the injection of
synthetic key events using the registers \$D615 -- \$D617.
The \stw{m65} utility uses this to allow remote typing on the MEGA65
in a way that is transparent to software.  There are three ways to use
this:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -t sometext
\end{screenoutput}

This form types the supplied text, in this case {\em sometext}, but
does not simulate pressing the \specialkey{RETURN} key.  If you wish
to simulate the pressing of the \specialkey{RETURN} key, use \stw{-T}
instead of \stw{-t}, e.g.:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -T list
\end{screenoutput}

This would cause the LIST command to be typed and executed.

Finally, it is possible to begin general remote keyboard control via:

\begin{screenoutput}
m65 -t -
\end{screenoutput}

In this mode, any key pressed on the keyboard of the computer
where \stw{m65} is running will be relayed to the MEGA65.  Note that
not all special keys are supported, and that there is some latency, so
using key repeat can cause unexpected results.  But for general remote
control, it is a very helpful facility.


\section{M65Connect}

This is a cross-platform graphical tool available for Windows, Linux
and MacOSX, which allows access to most of the functions of
the \stw{m65} command-line tool, without needing to use a
command line, or being able to compile the tool for your preferred
operating system.

\section{mega65\_ftp}

The \stw{mega65}\_\stw{ftp} utility from
the \url{https://github.com/mega65/mega65-tools} repository is a
little misleadingly named: While it 
is a File Transfer Programme, it does not use the File Transfer
Protocol (FTP).  Rather, it uses the serial monitor interface to take
remote control of a MEGA65, and directly access its SD card to enable
copying of files between the MEGA65 and the host computer.

Note that it does not perfectly restore the MEGA65's state on exit,
and thus should only be used when the MEGA65 is at the READY prompt,
so that any running software doesn't go haywire. In particular, you
should avoid using it when a sensitive programme is running, such as
the Freeze Menu, MEGA65 Configuration Utility, or the MEGA65
Format/FDISK utility.  (This problem could be solved with a little
effort, if someone has the time and interest to fix it).

When run, it provides an FTP-like interface that supports
the \stw{get}, \stw{put}, \stw{rename} and \stw{dir} commands.
Note that when putting a file, you should make sure that it is given a
name that is all capitals and has o DOS-compatible 8.3 character file
name.  This is due to limitations in both \stw{mega65}\_\stw{ftp} and the
MEGA65's Hypervisor's VFAT32 file system code. Again, these problems
could be fixed with a modest amount of effort on the part of a
motivated member of the community.

Finally, the \stw{mega65}\_\stw{ftp} programme is {\em very} slow to push
new files to the MEGA65, typically yielding speeds of around 5KB/sec.
This is partly because the serial monitor interface is capable of
transferring data at only 40KB/sec (when set to 4,000,000 bits per
second), and partly because the remote control process results in a
lot of round-trips where helper routines are executed on the MEGA65 to
read, write and verify sectors on the SD card.  It would be quite
feasible to improve this to reach close to 40KB/sec, and potentially
faster using either some combination of data compression,
de-duplication of identical sectors (especially when uploading disk
images) and other techniques. Again, this would be a very welcome
contribution that someone in the community could contribute to
everyone's benefit.

\section{TFTP Server}

Work on a true TFTP server for the MEGA65 that supports fast
TFTP transfers over the 100mbit ethernet has begun, and can be used to
very quickly read files from the MEGA65. Speeds of close to 1MB/sec
are possible, depending on SD card performance.  Rather than using
DHCP, this utility will respond to {\em any} IP address that ends in
.65. It always uses the MAC address 40:40:40:40:40:40. True DHCP
support as well as using the MEGA65's configured ethernet MAC address
may be added in the future. 

More importantly, support for writing
files to the SD card is not yet complete, and is blocked by the need
for the implementation of the necessary functions in the MEGA65's Hypervisor for creating and
growing files.  A particular challenge is enabling the creation of
files with contiguous clusters as is required for D81 disk images: If
a D81 file is fragmented, then it cannot be mounted, because the
mounting mechanism requires a pointer to the contiguous block of the
SD card containing the disk image.
In the interim, \stw{mega65}\_\stw{ftp} can be used as a substitute.
