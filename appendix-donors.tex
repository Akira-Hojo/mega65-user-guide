\chapter{Supporters \& Donors}

The MEGA65 would not have been possible to create without the generous support
of many organisations and individuals.

We are still compiling these lists, so apologies if we haven't included you yet.  If you
know anyone we have left out, please let us know, so that we can recognise the contribution
of everyone who has made the MEGA65 possible, and into the great retro-computing project
that it has become.
