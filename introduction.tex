\chapter{Introduction}

Congratulations on your purchase of one of the most long-awaited computers in the history of computing.
The MEGA65 is a community designed computer, based on the never-released Commodore{\textregistered}
65\footnote{Commodore is a trademark of C= Holdings} computer, that was first designed in
1989, and intended for public release in 1990.  Twenty-eight years have passed since then,
but the simple, friendly nature of the 1980s home computers is still something that hasn't
been recreated.  These were computers that were simple enough that you could understand not just
how to work with your computer, but how computers themselves work.

Many of the people who grew
up using the home computers of the 1980s now have exciting and rewarding jobs in many companies,
in part because of what they learnt about computers in the comfort of their own home.  We
want to give you that same opportunity, to experience the joy of learning how
to use computers to solve all sorts of problems: writing a letter to a friend,
working out how much tax you owe, inventing new things, or discovering how the universe works.
This is why we made the {\bf MEGA65}.

The MEGA65 team thinks that owning a computer should
be like owning a home: You don't just use a home, you change things big and small to really
make it your own, and maybe even renovate it or add on a room or two.  In this guide we will
show you how to more than just hang your own pictures on the wall, but instead how you can dream
up new ways of using the powerful capabilities of computers by coding your own computer programmes,
and even changing the computer itself!

To help you have fun with your MEGA65, we will show you how to use the exciting {\bf graphics} and {\bf sound}
capabilities of the MEGA65.  But the MEGA65 isn't just about writing your own programmes.
It can also run many of the thousands of games and other programmes that were created for the
Commodore{\textregistered} 64{\texttrademark}\footnote{Commodore 64 is a trademark of C= Holdings, } computer.

Welcome to the world of the {\bf MEGA65}!
