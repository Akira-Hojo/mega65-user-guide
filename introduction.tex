\chapter{Introduction}

Congratulations on your purchase of one of the most long awaited computers in the history of computing!
The {\bf MEGA65} is a community designed computer, based on the never-released Commodore{\texttrademark}
65\footnote{Commodore is a trademark of C= Holdings} computer, that was first designed in
1989, and intended for public release in 1990.  Twenty eight years have passed since then,
but the {\bf simple}, {\bf friendly} nature of the 1980s home computers is still something that has not
been recreated.  These were computers that were simple enough you could understand not just
how your computer worked, but how computers themselves work.

Many of the people who grew
up using the home computers of the 1980s have grown up to have exciting and rewarding jobs in many companies,
in part because of what they learnt about computers in the comfort of their own home.  We
want to give you that same opportunity, so that you can experience the joy of learning how
to use computers to solve all sorts of problems, whether that be writing a letter to a friend,
working out how much tax you owe, inventing new things, or working out how the universe works.
This is why we made the {\bf MEGA65}.

The {\bf MEGA65} team thinks that owning a computer should
be like owning a house: You don't just use a house, you change things big and small to really
make it your own, and maybe even renovate it or add on a room or two.  In this guide we will
show you how to more than just hang your own pictures on the wall, but instead how you can dream
up new ways of using the powerful capabilities of computers by coding your own computer programmes,
and even changing the computer itself!

To help you have fun with your {\bf MEGA65}, we will show you how to use the exciting {\bf graphics} and {\bf sound}
capabilities of the {\bf MEGA65}.  But the {\bf MEGA65} isn't just about writing your own programmes.
It can also run many of the thousands of games and other programmes that were created for the
Commodore 64{\texttrademark}\footnote{Commodore 64 is a trademark of C= Holdings, } computer.

Welcome to the world of the {\bf MEGA65}!
