\chapter{45GS02 \& 6502 Instruction Sets}

The 45GS02 CPU is able to operate in native mode, where it
is compatible with the CSG 4510, and in 6502 compatibility mode,
where 6502 undocumented instructions, also known as illegal
instructions, are supported for compatibility.  The instruction set and
timing information for both personalities are listed in the following
sections.

NOTE: The mechanisms for switching from 4510 to 6502 CPU personality
have yet to be finalised.

NOTE: Not all 6502 illegal opcodes are currently implemented.
