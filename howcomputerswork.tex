\chapter{How Computers Work}

Did you know that many computer experts and programmers learned how to use computers when they were still small children?
Home computers only became common in the early 1980s. They were so new, that people would often write programmes to do
what they wanted to do, because no software existed to do the job for them.

It was also quite common for people working in all
sorts of office jobs to learn how to program the computers they used for their jobs.  For example, the people processing payroll
for a company would often learn how to program the computer to calculate the everyone's pay!

Things have changed a lot since then, though.  Now most people choose existing programmes or apps to do what they need, and think that
programming is a specialised skill that only some people have the ability to learn.  But this isn't true.  Of course, like every other
field of pursuit everyone will be better at some things than others, whether it be sports, knitting, maths or writing. But almost
everyone is able to learn enough to help them in their life.

We created the MEGA65, because we believe that YOU can learn to programme, so that computers can be more useful to you, and as with
learning any new skill, that you can have the satisfaction and enjoyment and new adventures that this brings!

\section{Computers are stupid. Really stupid}

How can this be so? Computers are able to do so many different things, often thousands of times faster than a person can.
So how can we say that computers are stupid?  The answer is that no computer can do anything that it hasn't been instructed
by a person to do.  Even the latest Artificial Intelligence systems were taught how to learn (or how to learn how to learn).
To understand why this is so, it is helpful to understand how computers really work.

The heart of a computer is its Central Processing Unit, or CPU for short.  Many modern computers have more than one CPU, but let's keep
things simple to begin with.  The CPU has a set of simple instructions that it understands, like, ``get the thing from cup #21,'' ``put this thing into cup #403,'' ``add these things together,'' or ``do the following instruction, but only if the thing in cup #712 is the number 3.''

But what do we mean with all of these ``things'' and ``cups''? Let's start by thinking about how we could pretend to be a computer using
just an empty egg carton, some small pieces of paper and a pencil or pen.  Start by writing numbers, beginning with one, in each of the
little egg cups in the egg carton.  Then write the number zero on a little scrap of paper and put it in the first cup.  Do the same for the other cups. You should now have an egg carten with numbered cups, and with every cup having a scrap of paper with the number zero written on it. Now we just need a few simple rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item First, each cup is allowed to hold exactly one thing at a time. Never more. Never less.
\item Second,
