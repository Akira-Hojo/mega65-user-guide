\chapter{BASIC Tokenisers}

Various tokenisers for C64 BASIC exist, e.g., \url{https://github.com/catseye/hatoucan},
\url{https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/C64list}, or the \stw{petcat} utility that is part of VICE.
If you are using Ubuntu Linux, you can install \stw{petcat} by using the following command:

\begin{screenoutput}
sudo apt-get install vice
\end{screenoutput}

We recommend \stw{petcat}, because it supports both C64 BASIC 2 and C65 BASIC 10.
