% using a black filled label with rounded edges.
% In order to display a key as a title, use:

% For displaying a key as a part of the normal document flow, simply use:
%
%    \megakey{Shift}

% Other sizes are supported, as part of tcolorbox: http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/tcolorbox/tcolorbox.pdf#subsubsection.4.7.5 however, only `title' and the default: `small' are proposed for use in this manual.
