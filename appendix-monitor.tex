\chapter{Machine Language Monitor}

\section{Introduction}

The machine language monitor is a debugging tool for machine language
programs. It includes a mini-assembler, a disassembler and many useful commands.
When the program execution encounters the code 00 (zero) alias BRK,
the default action of the operating system is, to call the monitor.
This features allows the debugging of programs by setting breakpoints.

\section {calling the monitor}

To enter the monitor from BASIC, type:
\screentext{MONITOR}

The monitor responds with a display of register contents and waits for a command:

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=black,coltext=white]
\verbatimfont{\codefont}
\begin{verbatim}
    PC   SR AC XR YR ZR SP
; 000000 00 00 00 00 00 f8
\end{verbatim}
\end{tcolorbox}

\item [Format:] {\bf M [from [,to]]}
\item [Usage:] Prints a memory dump for the given address range.
               The dump displays memory contents, organized in rows
               of 16 consecutive addresses starting with the
               address, given as 1st. argument. The dump continues
               until a row has been printed, containing the value
               of the address given as 2nd. argument.
               If no 2nd. argument is present, the dump displays
               a full page of 256 bytes in 16 rows.
               The contents are printed as 16 byte values in hex,
               followed by the character representation.

\item [Remarks:] The rows start with the character '>'.
                 This enables direct full screen editing of the dump.
                 Typing return in any row will write the changed
                 values of the cursor row back to memory, if writable RAM is there.
                 See monitor command {\bf >}.

\item [Example:] Using {\bf M}
