\section{Keyboard}

Now that you have everything connected, it is time to get familiar with the Mega65 keyboard.

You will notice that the keyboard is a little different from the modern standard used on computers today. While most keys will be in familar positions, there are some specialised keys with special graphic symbols marked on the front.

What follows is a brief description of how some of these special keys function.

\megakey[title]{Return}

The \megakey{Return} key tells the computer to process the information you typed.

\megakey[title]{Shift}

The \megakey{Shift} key works just like on a typewriter or modern keyboard. It allows you to type uppercase letters when in lowercase mode, or to gain access to special graphic characters that are displayed on the right hand side of the front part of the key.

In the case of the function keys, pressing \megakey{Shift} will give you the function that is marked at the front of the key.

\megakey{\leftarrow} \megakey{\uparrow} \megakey{\rightarrow} \megakey{\downarrow} Cursor Keys

These keys move the cursor around the screen... etc etc.

\megakey[title]{Run/Stop}

Normally, pressing the \megakey{Run/Stop} key will stop execution of a program. When holding \megakey{Shift} while pressing \megakey{Run/Stop} will load the first program from disk.
