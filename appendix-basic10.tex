\chapter{BASIC 10 Command Reference}

\section{Format of Commands, Functions and Operators}

In this appendix each of the commands, functions and other callable elements of
BASIC 10 are described.
Some of these can take one or more arguments, that is, pieces of input that you
can (or sometimes must) provide as part of the command or function call.
Some also require that you use special keywords.
Here is an example of how commands, functions and operators will be described
in this appendix:

{\bf KEY <numeric expression>,<string expression> }

In this case, KEY is what we call a {\bf keyword}. That just means a special word that BASIC
understands.  Keywords are always written in CAPITALS, so that you can easily recognise them.

The {\bf <} and {\bf >} signs mean that whatever is between them must be there for the command, function or operator to work.
In this case, it tells us that we need to have a {\bf numeric expression} in one place, and a {\bf string expression} in another place.
We'll explain what there are a bit more in a few moments.

You might also see square brackets around something, for example, {\bf [,numeric expression]}.
This means that whatever appears between the square brackets is optional, that is, you can include it if you need to, but
that the command, function or operator will work just fine without it.  For example, the \screentext{CIRCLE} command has
an optional numeric argument to indicate if the circle should be filled when being drawn.

The comma, and some other symbols and punctuation marks just represent themselves.
In this case, it means that there must be a comma between the {\bf numeric expression} and the {\bf string expression}.
This is what we call syntax: If you miss something out, or put the wrong thing in the wrong place, it is called a
syntax error, and the computer will tell you if you have a syntax error by giving a \screentext{?SYNTAX ERROR} message.

There is nothing to worry about getting an error from the computer.
Instead, it is just the computer's way of telling you that something isn't quite right, so that you can more easily
find and fix the problem.
Error messages like this can't hurt the computer or damage your program, so there is nothing to worry about.
For example, if we accidentally left the comma out, or replaced it with a full-stop, the computer will respond with
a syntax error, like this:

\begin{screenoutput}
  KEY 8"FISH"

  ?SYNTAX ERROR

  KEY 8."FISH"

  ?SYNTAX ERROR
\end{screenoutput}

It is very common for commands, functions and operators to use one or more {\bf``expression''}.
An expression is just a fancy name for something that has a value.
This could be a string, such as \screentext{"HELLO"}, or a number, like \screentext{23.7}, or it could be a calculation, that might include
one or more functions or operators, such as \screentext{LEN("HELLO") * (3 XOR 7)}.
Generally speaking, expressions can result in either a string or numeric result.
In this case we call the expressions either string expressions or numeric expressions.
For example, \screentext{"HELLO"} is a {\bf string expression}, while \screentext{23.7} is a {\bf numeric expression}.

It is important to use the correct type of expression when writing your programs.
If you accidentally use the wrong type, the computer will give you a \screentext{?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR}, to say that the type
of expression you gave doesn't match what it expected, that is, there is a mismatch between the type of expression
it expected, and the one you gave.  For example, we will get a \screentext{?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR} if we type the following command,
because \screentext{"POTATO"} is a string expression instead of a numeric expression:

\begin{screenoutput}
  KEY "POTATO","SOUP"
\end{screenoutput}

You can try typing this into the computer yourself now, if you like.


\section{Commands}

\section{Functions}

Functions are different from commands in that they cannot be used on their own.
Instead, a function can only be used in an expression.
There are a variety of functions provided in BASIC 10.
Some can be used only on strings, while others can only be used on numbers.

\subsection{ABS - Absolute value function}

ABS(expression)

This function returns the absolute value of the numeric expression.
That is, it ignores the sign.  That is, if the value of the expression is positive,
the result will be the same, but if the value is negative, then the result
will be the positive number with the same magnitude, as the following examples show.

\begin{screenoutput}
  PRINT ABS(123)
  123
  PRINT ABS(-123)
  123
  PRINT ABS(4.5)
  4.5
  PRINT ABS(-4.5)
  4.5
  PRINT ABS(7-5)
  2
  PRINT ABS(5-7)
  2
\end{screenoutput}

The expression must be numeric. If you give it a string, the computer will indicate a type mismatch error.

\begin{screenoutput}
  PRINT ABS("POTATO")

  ?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR

  PRINT ABS("TWENTY")

  ?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR

  PRINT ABS("12")

  ?TYPE MISMATCH ERROR
\end{screenoutput}
