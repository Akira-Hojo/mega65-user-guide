Load Accumulator and X Registers (undocumented instruction)
A, X $\leftarrow$ M
N+Z+M+
This instruction loads both the Accumulator Register and X Register with the indicated
value, or with the contents of the indicated location.

NOTE: The LAX instruction is known to be unstable on many 6502 processors,
and should not be used. Non-immediate modes MAY be stable enough to be usable,
but should generally be avoided.
