MEM(SP + B1) + Y
Base-page indirect, stack-relative, post-indexed by Y register
This addressing mode is similar to the (indirect),Y mode,
except that the pointer address is the sum of the stack pointer and the
supplied argument.  This instruction implements de-referencing a
pointer stored on the stack, and is intended to make it much more efficient
to implement high-level programming languages that regularly pass pointers
via the stack.
