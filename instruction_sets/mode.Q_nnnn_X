Absolute Quad,X
This addressing mode operates on the supplied absolute address,
after first adding the value of the X register to the address.
The low-byte of the address is taken from the byte immediately
following the opcode. The high-byte of the address is taken from
the byte following that.

For example, if the X register contained $04, LDQ \$1234,X would load the Q pseudo register from
address \$1238 -- \$123B.
