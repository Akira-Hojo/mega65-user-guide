The argument to this address is an 8-bit relative address that is used
to compute the target branch address.

For example, BNE \$2000 would branch to location \$2000 if the zero flag is cleared.
This assumes
that the instruction is placed close enough in memory to location \$2000,
so that the relative address can be contained in a single byte. The
range of the relative address is -128 to +127 bytes.
