MEM(<(B2)):MEM(<(B1))
Absolute
This addressing mode operates on the supplied absolute address.
The low-byte of the address is taken from the byte immediately
following the opcode. The high-byte of the address is taken from
the byte following that.

For example, LDA \$1234 would load the accumulator from
address \$1234.
