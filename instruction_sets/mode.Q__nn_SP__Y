MEM(SP + B1) + Y
Base-page quad indirect, stack-relative, post-indexed by Y register
This addressing mode is similar to the (indirect quad),Y mode,
except that the pointer address is the sum of the stack pointer and the
supplied argument.  This instruction implements de-referencing a 32-bit
pointer stored on the stack, and is intended to make it much more efficient
to implement high-level programming languages that regularly pass pointers
via the stack.
