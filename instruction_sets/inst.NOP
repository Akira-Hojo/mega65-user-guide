No-Operation (undocumented instruction)


These instructions act as null instructions: They perform
the bus accesses as though they were real instructions, but
then do nothing with the retrieved value. They can thus be used
either as delay instructions, or to read from registers that
have side-effects when read, without corrupting a register.
