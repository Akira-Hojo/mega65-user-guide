No-Operation (some are unintended opcodes)


These instructions act as null instructions: They perform
the bus accesses as though they were real instructions, but
then do nothing with the retrieved value. They can thus be used
either as delay instructions, or to read from registers that
have side-effects when read, without corrupting a register.

Only \$EA is an intended opcode for NOP on the 6502. All others
are only available on NMOS versions of the processor, or the 
45GS02 in 6502 mode.
