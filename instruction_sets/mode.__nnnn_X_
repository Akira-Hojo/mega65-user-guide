MEM(<(B2)):MEM(<(B1)) + X
Indirect,X
This memory address uses the supplied address as a pointer
to, to which X is added.  It is only available for use with
the JMP instruction and logically implements jumping to an address in a
jump-table.

For example, If X contains \$04, JMP (\$1234,X) would load read the location to jump to
from memory locations \$1238 and \$1239.  For example, if memory
location \$1238 contains \$78 and memory location \$1239 contains \$56,
then the next instruction to be executed would be read from location
\$5678.
