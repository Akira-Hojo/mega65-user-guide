base-page and relative

$^{b}$
B1, PC+B2
This addressing mode uses the first argument to indicate a
base-page address that will be subjected to the bit test.
The second argument is an 8-bit relative address that is used
to compute the target branch address.

For example, BBR0 \$12,\$2000 would branch to location \$2000 if
bit 0 of location \$12 in the base-page contains a zero. This assumes
that the instruction is placed close enough in memory to location \$2000,
so that the relative address can be contained in a single byte. The
range of the relative address is -128 to +127 bytes.
