Transfer Y Register into Stack Pointer High (SPH) Register
SPH $\leftarrow$ Y

This instruction sets the high byte of the Stack Pointer (SPH)
register to the contents of the Y Register.  This allows
changing the memory page where the stack is located (if the Extended Stack
Disable Flag (E) is set), or else allows setting the current Stack
Pointer to any page in memory, if the Extended Stack Disable
Flag (E) is clear.
