MEM(<(B2)):MEM(<(B1))
Absolute Quad
This addressing mode operates on the supplied absolute address.
The low-byte of the address is taken from the byte immediately
following the opcode. The high-byte of the address is taken from
the byte following that.

For example, LDQ \$1234 would load the Q pseudo register from
addresses \$1234 -- \$1237.
