Set Memory Map


This instruction sets the C65 or MEGA65 style memory map, depending
on the values in the Accumulator, X, Y and Z registers.

Care should be taken to ensure that after the execution of an
MAP instruction that appropriate memory is mapped at the location
of the following instruction.  Failure to do so will result in
unpredictable results.

Further information on this instruction is available in Appendix \ref{cha:cpu}.


\subsubsection*{Side effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item The memory map is immediately changed to that requested.
\item All interrupts, including Non-Maskable Interrupts (NMIs) are
blocked from occurring until an EOM (NOP) instruction is encountered.
\end{itemize}
