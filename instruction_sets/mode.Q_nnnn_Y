Absolute Quad,Y
This addressing mode operates on the supplied absolute address,
after first adding the value of the Y register to the address.
The low-byte of the address is taken from the byte immediately
following the opcode. The high-byte of the address is taken from
the byte following that.

For example, if the Y register contained $04, LDQ \$1234,Y would load the Q pseudo register from
addresses \$1238(LSB) -- \$123B(MSB).
