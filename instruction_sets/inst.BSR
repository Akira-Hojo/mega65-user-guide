Branch Sub-Routine
PC $\leftarrow$ PC + R8 $or$ PC $\leftarrow$ PC + R16

This instruction branches to the indicated address, saving
the address of the caller on the stack, so that the routine
can be returned from using an RTS instruction.

This instruction is helpful for using relocatable code, as it
provides a relative-addressed alternative to JSR.
