MEM(<(1+B1)):MEM(<(0+B1)) + Z
Base-page indirect, post-indexed by Z register
This addressing mode uses the Zth byte of the memory indicated
by a 16-bit pointer stored in the base-page.

For example, LDA (\$12),Z would load the accumulator from
the address whose low byte is read from \$12 and whose
high-byte is read from \$12 + 1.  For example, if Z held
the value \$04, and location \$12 held \$34 and location \$13 held \$12, then
A would be loaded with the contents of location \$1238.

This instruction normally forms 16-bit addresses using
pairs of bytes. To use a 32-bit address pointer, proceed it with a NOP
instruction.  In this case it will read four consecutive addresses from
the base-page to form the pointer.  This adds 2 cycles to the execution
time, in addition to the 1 cycle cost of the NOP instruction.
