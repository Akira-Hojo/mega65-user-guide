MEM(<(1+B1)):MEM(<(0+B1)) + Y
Base-page indirect, post-indexed by Y register
This addressing mode uses the Yth byte of the memory indicated
by a 16-bit pointer stored in the base-page.

For example, LDA (\$12),Y would load the accumulator from
the address whose low byte is read from \$12 and whose
high-byte is read from \$12 + 1.  For example, if Y held
the value \$04, and location \$12 held \$34 and location \$13 held \$12, then
A would be loaded with the contents of location \$1238. 

NOTE: This instruction always forms 16-bit addresses using
pairs of bytes. To use a 32-bit address pointer that references the
MEGA65's flat address space, use the (indirect),Z mode instead.
