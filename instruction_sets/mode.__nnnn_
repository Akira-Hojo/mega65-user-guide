MEM(<(B2)):MEM(<(B1))
Indirect
This memory address uses the supplied address as a pointer
to obtain the actual value.  It is only available for use with
the JMP instruction.

For example, JMP (\$1234) would load read the location to jump to
from memory locations \$1234 and \$1235.  For example, if memory
location \$1234 contains \$78 and memory location \$1235 contains \$56,
then the next instruction to be executed would be read from location
\$5678.
