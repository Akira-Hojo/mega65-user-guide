MEM(<(B2)):MEM(<(B1)) + Z
Absolute,Z
This addressing mode operates on the supplied absolute address,
after first adding the value of the Z register to the address.
The low-byte of the address is taken from the byte immediately
following the opcode. The high-byte of the address is taken from
the byte following that.

For example, if the Z register contained $04, LDA \$1234,Z would load the accumulator from
address \$1238.
