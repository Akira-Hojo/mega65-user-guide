\chapter{F018-Compatible Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller}
\label{cha:dmagic}

The MEGA65 includes an F018/F018A backward-compatible DMA controller.
Unlike in the C65, where the DMA controller exists as a separate
chip, it is part of the 45GS02 processor in the MEGA65.  However, as the
use of the DMA controller is a logically separate topic, it is documented
separately in this appendix.
