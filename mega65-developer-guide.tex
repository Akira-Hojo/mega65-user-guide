\part{INTRODUCTION}

\chapter{Welcome, and thank you!}

I would like to begin by thanking you for your interest in the MEGA65,
and in developing software to run on it. The success of the MEGA65 as
a fun retro-computing platform depends on there being enough
interesting software for people to run on it.  This requires the
generous work of developers like yourself. So, again, thank you!

But developing for the MEGA65 is not merely a case of giving to the
benefit of others. We have tried hard to create a machine that is as
fun to programme as the Commodore 64, but with some of the barriers
and frustrations worn down somewhat.  That is, it is our intention
that people develop on the MEGA65 because it is fun, and then enjoy
the process.  That is, the journey should very much be the
destination.

Now, in saying that, the MEGA65 is quite new, and we have been flat
out creating the machine. This means that some development tools are
not as ready or as simple or integrated as we would like.  Improving
the tools is also an area where we hope that many of you will enjoy
contributing, so that developing for the MEGA65 can become accessible
to as many people as possible.

If you encounter barriers to your
journey of developing for the MEGA65, please do let us know, and
consider creating solutions that can be shared with others.  This will
help everyone

\chapter{Other Resources}

This book focusses on the process of developing for the MEGA65.  To
avoid it being a thousand pages long, it doesn't describe the inner
workings of the MEGA65, except where you need to know about them, so
that you can engage in the development process.  For example, if you
wish to know about the capabilities of the various custom chips in the
MEGA65, and which registers do which things, please refer to {\em the
MEGA65 Book} online
at \url{https://github.com/mega65/mega65-user-guide}, or consider
purchasing one or more of the reference volumes for the MEGA65, from
which the MEGA65 Book is formed.  For example, the {\em MEGA65 Chipset
Reference Guide} or the {\em MEGA65 Assembly Language Reference Guide}.

We also hope that you, the developer community, will contribute to
those books, or write your own material that can help others in their
journies with developing for the MEGA65.
